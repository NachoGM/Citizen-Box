# Citizen-Box
This is the Citizen Box, one of the first Apps I developed. Here you will find an awesome App with some frameworks like Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, SVProgressHUD or SwiftyOnboard. Enjoy it!

Sample project developed by myself. (might be facebook sdk will be deprecated)

If you want to open this project you must update pods.

To do that open your terminal and go to the project folder and write pod install.

Enjoy it!
